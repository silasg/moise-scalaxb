# Welcome to moise-scalaxb!

moise-scalaxb is basically generated Scala code from [os.xsd](http://moise.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/moise/trunk/src/xml/os.xsd?revision=249&view=markup) from the [Moise project](http://moise.sourceforge.net/), a Java implementation of Moise+ model for specifying multi-agent system organizations. The code was generated by [scalaxb](http://scalaxb.org/) 0.5.4, a XML-binding tool for Scala.

moise-scalaxb is needed as a library for [Moise-DSL](https://github.com/silasg/moise-dsl), an embedded domain-specific language written in Scala that is converted to the XML-based _Organization Modelling Language_ defined by the XML schema definition above.

moise-scalaxb was compiled using Scala 2.8.1 and Netbeans 6.9 with Scala Plugin but you can build moise-scalaxb using other Scala versions and Ant, too.
